# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve this project. Because this is a hardware-specific NixOS configuration, changes should be reproducible, clearly scoped, and explicit about what was and was not tested.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a focused feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```
3. Make the smallest change that addresses the issue.
4. Run the relevant checks below and include their results in the pull request.
5. Open a pull request with a clear explanation and reproduction steps.

## Validation

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
nix develop ./nixos --command bash -euo pipefail -c '

```

The `scripts/pci-address.sh` helper is included in ShellCheck because the installer sources it. `statix check .` and `deadnix .` are required CI gates; `statix.toml` disables only the style-only repeated-key lint, not actionable static-analysis findings.

Source provenance is part of the migration contract: clean installation, manual migration, and `install.sh` record the actual Git commit in `/etc/nixos/.source-revision`. VM preparation refuses a missing/malformed marker, a different commit, or a dirty checkout. Canonical source ZIPs embed their commit using Git's `export-subst`; arbitrary ZIP exports without that identity are not accepted by the migration helper.

For changes to NixOS options or kernel inputs, also evaluate the relevant output and, where feasible, run a real `nixos-rebuild dry-activate`.

The `scripts/test-vm-xml-sync.py` suite also mocks libvirt to verify that a registered inactive `win10` definition from `virsh dumpxml --inactive` takes precedence over stale/missing `/var/lib/libvirt/win10.xml`, that live and on-disk definitions are backed up, and that failed `virsh` queries abort before modifying files. Do not claim that the full kernel or system builds unless the build was actually completed. The `--no-build` CI step only evaluates the flake; a separate targeted build verifies the selected LSFG-VK package. The Nix formatting check uses `nixfmt --check` and does not rewrite source files.

The 2026-10-16 hardware result documented in README.md was obtained with standard (non-RT) BORE-LTO and is historical. In a later update dated 2026-10-23, the project owner reported that the target machine rebuilt successfully with RT-Bore-LTO ThinLTO, compiled the kernel, started and shut down the Windows VM, and returned to the Hyprland host session. This is owner-reported target-system validation, not independent reproduction or a compatibility guarantee for other hardware. The RT-Bore-LTO variant is not published in the upstream binary cache, so each newly selected upstream revision must be built locally and its boot and VM lifecycle revalidated before relying on it.

For VM XML changes, keep the project-specific invariant test up to date and validate the definition with the target host's libvirt/QEMU. A well-formed XML document can still reference an unsupported machine type or unavailable host resources.

For VFIO hook changes, run the mock driver-state regression test and document which branches it covers. It is not a substitute for testing the real GPU lifecycle on hardware. Single-GPU passthrough can terminate the host graphical session; arrange a recovery TTY or SSH path before running it.

## Style

- Use two-space indentation in Nix files and format them with `nixfmt`.
- Use `nixfmt --check` for validation; formatting edits should be reviewed separately.
- Keep shell scripts compatible with the Bash runtime they declare and check them with ShellCheck.
- Prefer declarative NixOS configuration over manual runtime changes.
- Keep comments and documentation accurate; remove stale explanations rather than appending contradictory notes.
- Never commit host-specific secrets, password hashes, personal SSH keys, or test data.

## Pull requests

Include the motivation, a summary of changed files, test output, known limitations, and screenshots only when a UI change needs them. If a change is host-specific, state the required hardware and firmware assumptions.

## Bug reports

Include the NixOS release, `uname -r`, CPU/GPU model, relevant logs, the exact command that failed, and whether the failure occurred during evaluation, derivation building, activation, or runtime. Redact secrets and personal identifiers.
